## 9 days have passed, we're still waiting for you coming back home.

As is known to all, an aircraft left Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41am last Saturday and was expected to land in Beijing at 6:30 am at the same day, but it losts radar contact in airspace in an hour after taking off. The jet carried 239 people, including 154 Chinese and one of them is my friend from USC, [Qiao Xing][qx]. 

I can't believe tragedy happens to my friend again. As two years ago, two of my friends from USC, Ying Wu and Ming Qu were killed in their car on a cold raining night. Dramatically, I knew Qiao from the shooting incident, becasue she and Ying are very close friends and she took charge of dealing with the aftermath. She was so conscientious at that time that she gathered all of us, who are close to Ying and Ming, to hold memorial service, consult detetives about the case, take care of their parents when they came to LA and hold funeral, etc. She is very smart and mature and as kind and lovely as Ying. People say it's more likely to be friends with someone similar from you, I guess that's why they're such close friends. Her last activity on [Renren][renren](Chinese Facebook) is tagged as visiting the parents of Ying and Ming after the sentencing hearing. Several days after the hearing, she took flight MH370 from Malaysia back to China and vanished with the other 238 people on board in the sky ever since. 

I was shocked when I saw her name in the manifest of the missing airline. I had exactly the same thoughts as two years ago when I heared the name of Ying of the shooting. At first, I thought it must not be her, it must be someone else who happens to have the same name. Then I checked [Renren][renren] and [Weibo][weibo] to make sure it's not her. However, things go crisscross. I was choked with sobs when I confirmed it's someone I know. I questioned the God, "Why? Why did it happen to my friend? And again?", and then I realized how precious and fragile life is, how lucky I am to enjoy the light of sun. Nothing is more important compared to life.

The latest news from Malaysia Prime Minister that someone deliberately disabled the transponder and changed routes gives hope to everybody. As more and more signs indicate it's hijacking, I hope the aircraft has already landed on an island in Southen Indian Ocean. Everyone on board is alive and stay on the island waiting for us to rescue. I prefer to believe it is a live show of "Lost", it must be.
